1.  [Download sample data for a county in England](outputs.qmd)
2.  [Explore how to use the data](use_output.qmd)
3.  If you need a different study area, [build](installation.qmd) and then [run](custom_areas.qmd) SPC

## What SPC does

The SPC generates spatially enriched synthetic population outputs for multiple
administrative and census boundaries including Local Authority Districts - LADs
and Counties across England. The output file generated by SPC has a granularity
of Middle Layer Super Output Areas - MSOAs. This file is structured to help
other researchers or urban analysts to feed other dynamic models for multiples
purposes where an enriched synthetic population file is required. SPC includes
a comprehensive set of variables that include sociodemographic characteristics,
daily activities, and other extra data sources to help you model the complexity
of British society. 

## What output SPC generates

You can see all of the per-person, household, and MSOA information SPC gives
you in the
[schema](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-spc/blob/main/synthpop.proto).
We use [protocol
buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) to
efficiently encode the data and describe its shape.
