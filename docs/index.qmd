![SPC Schema](img/UK_LAD.png)

The Synthetic Population Catalyst (SPC) makes it easier for researchers to work
with synthetic population data in England. It combines a variety of [data
sources](data_sources.qmd) and outputs a single file in
[protocol buffer
format](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-spc/blob/main/synthpop.proto), describing
the population in a given study area. The tool also provides methods to export
the outcome in diferent formats often use for researchers like CSV or JSON.

The input of the SPC tool is a list of the Middle Layer Super Output Area
(MSOAs) where you want to create a spatially enriched sythetic population to
feed other dynamic models. SPC includes a script to assist you with the proper
list of the MSOAs by defining a Local Authority District area in England. [Get
started](getting_started.qmd) to download SPC data or run the tool in different
MSOAs.
