The Synthetic Population Catalyst (SPC) makes it easier for researchers to work
with synthetic population data in England. It combines a variety of [data
sources](data_sources.qmd) and outputs a single file in [protocol buffer
format](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-spc/blob/main/synthpop.proto),
describing the population in a given study area. The data includes demographic,
health, and daily activity data per person, and information about the venues
where people conduct activities.

You can use SPC output to catalyze your own project. Rather than join together
many [raw data sources](data_sources.qmd) yourself and deal with missing and
messy data, you can leverage SPC's effort and well-documented schema.

To get started:

1.  [Download sample data for a county in England](outputs.qmd)
2.  [Explore how to use the data](use_output.qmd)
3.  If you need a different study area, [build](installation.qmd) and then [run](custom_areas.qmd) SPC
